# Brand-Logo-Detection-with-YOLOv5

Used 10 classes inside flickr27 : http://image.ntua.gr/iva/datasets/flickr_logos/

ToYolo converts from corner to corner notation to center and w/h notation. 

You need to include your API key from roboflow into the ipynb section that says "INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE" , it'll show you the whole part actually , just copy that and paste into that box.

test.py runs detection , most of the parameters are self explanatory , if you are having problem try looking at yolov5 ultralytics github page 

requires CUDA/torch setup 

torch requires files inside folders
